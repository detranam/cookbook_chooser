#This file will deal with all the JSON parsing, both in and out, to allow for
#book manipulation in this library.
#This file should also be the main command line application, allowing for pretty-printing of 
#the entire library. This should also allow us to randomly choose a page from ALL BOOKS, a subgenre of books.
