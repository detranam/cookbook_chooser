# cookbook_chooser.py

## Goals
- [x] Be able to parse a json list of cookbooks
- [x] Be able to accept a new book and append it to the json library
- [x] Be able to randomly recieve a recipe from any book
- [x] Be able to list all books (pretty printed)

## Usage
This personal project was created out of a desire for an easier way to 
manage any books, though in my case they are cookbooks. Having a JSON file
with lengths, types, and chapters is all useful so that I can know what is
actually in my library. Choosing a random recipe is a fun option, too.
This project is also useful because it's a great base for other programs,
any sort of JSON manipulation with the Book objects wouldn't be too hard,
so this may be useful to keep a list of other books that I own in a neat
and organized manner.
